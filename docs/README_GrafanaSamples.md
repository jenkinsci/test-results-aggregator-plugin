# Test Results Aggregator and Grafana Integration

A sample of Grafana Dashboard for Test Results Aggregator is  [Test Results Aggregator.json](grafana/Test%20Results%20Aggregator.json)

You can import it into your Grafana installation. Requires a InfluxDB data source already configured.
 
The json sample file uses a bucket named "TestResultsAggregatorBucket" so replace it or generate a new bucket according to Test Result Aggregator influxdbBucket param, see '[pipeline](README_Pipeline.md)' .
